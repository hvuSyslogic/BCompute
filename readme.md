BCompute is a simple bioinformatics library for .NET

####Overview
BCompute is a strongly-typed, sanity-checked, performant library for parsing common sequence file formats, manipulating sequences, and answering genetics questions in general.

In general, you'll see that the library grows in the same direction as the Rosalind.info problem set, which reflects the generalization work I do as I solve each problem. Unit test coverage for non-trivial library methods should be fairly close to 100%.

####Guiding principles
1. Favor correctness over performance
2. Favor clarity over brevity
3. Favor platformization over library purity

####Motivation
BCompute is a fun learning exercise to explore biological computing.
